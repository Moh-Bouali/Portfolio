          <h1>Welcome to my portfolio !</h1>
          <p class="major">
            My name is Mohammed Bouali, I was born in Oran, Algeria. A city just
            by the Mediterranean sea in Northern Africa. Moved to Qatar when I
            was a baby and grew up there but went back to Oran when I was 13.
            I Finished my middle and high school there and after graduating in
            2016 I decided to take a year off and travel ! I went to visit Qatar
            again in addition to Europe (Netherlands, Austria and France). 
					</p>
						<p class="major">In 2017 I started studying what is equivalent to an MBO but in Algeria
							in Network and Systems administration (Administering Linux systems,
							Cisco routers etc..) and that's how I got into the field of IT. But
							after graduating I realised that if I ever want to really advance in
							my tech career then I should move to Western Europe and the
							Netherlands made the most sense as both of my older brother lives here 
              and it was the best option in the EU for an English speaker.
							<p class="major"> Unfortunately, when I wanted to pack my bags and move a certain new
								virus decided to show up... so I had to postpone it until summer
								2021. That is when I started a bachelor's in ICT at Fontys
								University of Applied sciences and decided to continue on with
								Software Engineering as I just loved how you can see what you
								created come into life, it feels like your own baby in a way. So
								that's pretty much it about me !</p>

          <h2>Tournament Management Application</h2>
          <p>
            My first software project was during my 1st year, 2nd semester to be more precise. I was tasked to make a 
						tournament management system with C# using .NET framework with a login feature as well as CRUD features. In addition to that there was some logic such as 
						the rules of the games must be different depending on which type of tournament you play. For example, in a tennis tournament you cannot
						have a score of 99-97, therefore the system makes sure that the scoring is according to the game that is being played. In addition to that, the scheduling of games is done in a round robin way, for that I had to use a round robin algorithim. Finally,
						there was also a leaderboard feature that would show the leaderboard of players from best to worst.
          </p>
					<p>The goal of this year was to understand the basics of coding and to get to know what are SOLID principles and what clean code really is. In addition to applying simple algorithims

				<h2>Food delivery application (BACKEND)</h2>
				<p>
					In my second project which was during my 2nd year, 3rd semester to be precise. I had to choose my own topic, I decided to make an application that is
					similar to Thuisbezorgd/Uber eats, where users can login and search for their favourite restaurant and make an order. For that I used Java with Spring Boot framework.
					There were features such as Authentication and Authorization using Spring security in order to generate JWT tokens, SOLID principles had to be respected with proper
					layering of the application and websockets had to be implemented. In addition ofcourse to a database connection in order to store and retrieve data, for that I used
					Mariadb database as a docker image
				</p>
				<p>The goal of this assignment was to understand the fundamentals of creating a full stack web application with SOLID princples. 
          In addition to being able to dockerize the application and to run it through a CI/CD pipeline where all the tests are ran automatically in addition to sonarqube
					which is a tool that checks the quality of the code. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is the backend part, I personally see the backend and frontend as 2 seperate applications, the section below explains the frontend part

				<h2>Food delivery application (FRONTEND)</h2>
				<p>
					For the frontend of the Food delivery application I used REACT.js, For our study we do not focus much on the frontend in terms of UI/UX, as long 
					as there is a frontend where you can input data and view data then that is all that matters, infact there was also an option
          to only use postman for testing the backend if we wished, but I wanted to learn REACT, that is why I chose to develop a dedicated frontend.
          Having said that, at that time (between September 2022 and December 2022) my CSS skills
          were not the best, in addition to that I never had the time to get to focus
					a lot on improving my CSS skills since I had to focus a lot on the backend implementation and implementing
          other technologies such as CI/CD pipeline, docker, testing, database design... that is why in terms of design I know that it is not the most beautiful one,
          but the goal of the semester was to be able to develop a full stack application, the design was of low priority during that semester.
          Therefore, I developed something basic mostly using bootstrap just to showcase that my backend works properly and that I know REACT, but after the semester ended
          I made a decision to improve my CSS skills, so I decided to buy an online course to learn how to create
					responsive web designs. I learnt a lot from it, and to showcase that, you can find in the next 2 sections 
          2 static web pages that I developed.

          <h2>Omnifood frontend page</h2>
          <p>
            As mentioned in the previous section, I took an online web design course to improve my CSS skills, during
            that course the instructor tasked us to develop a static frontend page, basically how it would work is That
            he would explain what he would like us to do next and show us how it should look like, then we pause the video
            and try it on our own, I will admit that there were certain parts where I was stuck and had to continue watching
            to see the solution, but that was rare, I would say that the vast majority of the webpage I managed to develop
            on my own without seeing the solution first.

            The webpage is longer that what is shown on the screenshot to the left, please feel free to downloading
            it from my github and running it locally, then you can view the full webpage.

          <h2>JustEat takeway replica</h2>
          <p>
            Since I work at Thuisbezorgd part time delivering food (A nice student job I must say, especially since
            I enjoy biking!), I thought why not to try to apply what I learned from the Web design course that I took by 
            developing a replica of their website, besides, my semester 3 project (the foodapp one that I mentioned before)
            is about delivering food, and I have always had it in my to-do list to re-do that design, since as mentioned
            before my CSS skills were not the best back then, so by making this static webpage, I could create a new
            REACT app and I would just have to copy this HTML and CSS to it mostly. I just never had the time to do it with school and work, in 
            addition to private life matters.

          <h2>Internship at Vanderlande</h2>
          <p>
            I will not be able to share all the details of what I worked on nor the code due to my non-disclosure agreement
            with Vanderlande, but what I can say is the following:
            <br>
            This internship was mostly frontend related, I used Angular JS in order to develop a UI
            to test a concept that the company has had for some time, by developing this UI I was also tasked to 
            test the concept of it with a certain department within Vanderlande as it was supposed to be for them
            to make their work easier and more effecient, then I had to forward my findings to Vanderlande and 
            advise them in how to proceed.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to developing the UI itself with Angular, I also had to make a mock server in order to 
            mock the backend API, for that I used Java Spring boot, I had to also make a database design model
            and discussed it with one of their senior software engineers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall it was a very good internship, I got the chance to work more on the frontend, since it was
            the part of the stack that I was not really comfortable with I wanted to get out of my comfort zone
            and try it, I ended up genuinly enjoying it and now I have more of a preference towards it, in 
            addition to that I got to experience what it like to work within a professional company and how to work
            with real stakeholders and product owners, it was a great experience and I thank Vanderlande for it!

          <h2>What am I doing now?</h2>
          <p>
            At this moment of time I have just finished with my internship at Vanderlande, I believe that now
            is the time for me to try and get my foot into the professional field, I genuinly believe that I 
            have the required skills for a junior software developer role. The best way for me to really take
            my skills to the next level is to start working professionally, that is why I am currently looking
            for a part-time job, I can do both backend and frontend, I will be honest that I am slowly gaining
            a preference for frontend even more as time goes on, I like how I can immediately view what I have worked
            on, but I am flexible, if I would have to also work on the backend part aswell then I would not mind that,
            especially as I am always willing to learn, so at this stage of my career, I am very much open to trying
            out different parts of the stack and different technologies.
            <br>
            <br>
            My perfect scenario would be to find a company where I could start as a part-timer now, then do my 
            graduation internship with them (which is due to start on February 2025), after that by June 2025 I would
            have already graduated and why not continue with that company as a full-time employee for the long-term. Basically,
            I am looking forward for a long-term collaboration, where I can start as a junior now at a company and grow 
            with them, since as I already mentioned, the best way to learn is to actually work on professional products
            in a company alongside other senior software engineers. School has given me good pillars, now I have
            to build on that and take it to the next level.
            <br>
            <br>
            For now I have already started a REACT online course, I would like to go again through some concepts and to 
            especially dive deeper into state management and REDUX. As I said, I am always willing to learn.
            <br>
            <br>
